                <h3>My Achievements</h3>
                <p>
                    My greatest accomplishment to date is the medal I received for placing second in the interscholastic speech
                    competition which was about right to education. As a member of the Art and Cultural club at my high school, I 
                    organized numerous events and decorated them to raise money. I three times received a GPA of 4 on my final exam
                    when I was in school, and I also participated in extracurricular activities like painting. Additionally, I picked
                    up the programming languages Python and Java. I gained knowledge about web design techniques like Cascading Style 
                    Sheets and Hyper Text Markup Language.
